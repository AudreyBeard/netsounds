Sonification of convolutional neural networks

## Functionality
Currently, we've got a modified pretrained SqueezeNet v1.0 running some home
images, and dumping the activations at certain layers out as numpy pickles.

To do this, run `python3 test_squeezenet.py` from `/src/models/`

## TODO
- [ ] Dump images in `test_squeezenet.py`
- [ ] Explore the activations at different layers
